#HOW TO
Pre-requisite
Have docker and docker-compose installed

Start ldap-mock

1) Generate the certificates
   cd ldap_mock_server_git
   ./cert_generator_v3.sh
2) Bring up docker container
    docker-compose up -d

How to access?
If non-tls http://publicIP:389
If using tls https://publicIP:636

NOTE: 
If you don t want to use certificates, disable it on the docker-compose.yml file changing the variable LDAP_TLS=false.
If you want to include more users, include it on the file ldap-data/02-users.ldif
